## Usage

*This is an advanced feature. Feel free to ask us for help!*

There are certain system-specific [Built-In Macros](https://github.com/ianfhunter/GNOLL/tree/main/builtins) for you to take advantage of.

Before rolling your dice, you can define some macros

All strings (words) must be capitalized. This is to avoid confusion with the rest of the dice notation

`$EVENSIX= {2,4,6,8,10,12}`

You can use ranges

`$DTWENTYBONUS = {1..20, 30}`

You can also use words

`$FRIENDS={JOHN,MARY,TAI}`
