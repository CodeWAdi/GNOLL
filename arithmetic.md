## Numeric Dice
For Numeric Dice, math follows normal conventions.
- Add (+):
  - 1+2 = 3
- Subtract (-):
  - 4-3 = 1
- Multiply (*):
  - 5*2: 10
- Divide (rounding up(\\) and rounding down(/)):
  - 10/2: 5
-Modulo (%):
  - 10%3 = 1
- Brackets (())

{: .warning }
> Be careful with characters like \ and / and be sure to escape them if needed in your calling program.


{: .explanation}
> Other dice notation parsers either choose to round up, down or allow floating points.
>
> With the two styles of division, we intend to remove the necessity for early introduction to Functions

## Symbolic Dice
For Symbolic Dice, even if the symbols are numbers, the logic is different as GNOLL treats the values as strings (words).

- Add (+) Concatenate two symbols: "A"+"B" = "AB"
- Subtract (-) Remove if there is overlap between symbols:
  - "AAA"-"C"= "AAA".  
  - "ABA"-"A"= "BA"
- Multiply (*) - Duplicate if multiplying by a number. Cannot multiply by a symbol
  - "A" * 5 = "AAAAA"
  - "A" * "B" = ERR
- Divide (\\ or /): Currently always produces an error.
- Modulo (%): Currently always produces an error.
- Brackets (())
